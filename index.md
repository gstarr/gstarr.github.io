**Graham Starr** (me) is a journalist making things with math, art, and computers, currently senior editor at [*Business Insider*](https://www.businessinsider.com/sai), where I oversee technology coverage. (To reach me securely, use my [PGP public key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xDB0D92DF71F4416F) when you [send me an email](mailto:gstarr@insider.com?subject=Hi%20Graham%21); here is a [guide to setting up PGP](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-encrypt-your-email-180878).)   

I’ve written about business and technology for *The New York Times*, *Wired*, *The Atlantic*, *New York* Magazine, and Slate, and my [projects](https://gstarr.me/projects/misc/) have been featured in the *Washington Post*, *Fortune*, NPR, and HuffPost, among others. In 2017, I was part of the team that won an ASME Award for work on an [interactive timeline](https://www.theatlantic.com/timeline). Breitbart once wrote about [one of my projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2ybupRgffE) and [put my name in scare-quotes](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/02/24/new-app-splits-dinner-bills-according-to-race-and-gender/) for the entire thing. It was weird!         

Before *Business Insider*, I was a senior staff editor at [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/) where I worked on features, digital projects, visual storytelling packages, and breaking news, and edited and reported stories about business and technology. Before The *Times*, I was a special projects editor at [*New York* Magazine](http://nymag.com), where I edited pop-up blogs and feature packages for [Select All](https://nymag.com/selectall), the magazine's tech blog. Before *New York*, I was the research assistant to [*WIRED*](https://www.wired.com/)’s editor-in-chief, Nicholas Thompson. And before *WIRED*, I was a member of [*The Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com)’s [special projects](https://theatlantic.com/projects) team. Before that, I was a teenager and, earlier, a baby.

I occasionally work with NYU’s [Interactive Telecommunications Program](https://itp.nyu.edu/), where I lead workshops on media, art, and technology.      

<!-- In college, I was editor-in-chief of Tufts University’s humor magazine, *[The Zamboni](http://www.tuftszamboni.com/)*. I revived and [redesigned](http://dropr.com/gstarr/57501/humor_magazine_redesign/) the then-25-year-old publication, launched its first website, and grew its staff from five to 60. The group’s official constitution is [pretty wild](https://twitter.com/GrahamStarr/status/798772163855532032). -->
