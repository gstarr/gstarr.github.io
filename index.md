**Graham Starr** is a New York-based freelance writer, designer, journalist, and humorist who makes things with computers. He made this website. He also made this text. Sometimes "things" means words and not just tangible objects as we prototypically assume it does. Graham is really into linguistics. He also likes italicized ampersands: *&*. He usually only speaks in the third person for one paragraph.  

This summer I was a [Dow Jones News Fund](http://www.newsfund.org/) Digital Media Intern at the award-winning [Christian Science Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/About/People/Graham-Starr) in Boston. There, I served as a staff writer covering technology and culture for the Innovations desk. I also served as a digital designer, leading the mobile and tablet team on the website's feature redesign. After my internship ended, I was kept on as a freelance designer. In college, I was Editor-in-Chief of [Tufts University's humor magazine](http://www.tuftszamboni.com/) (this would be weird if I didn't go to Tufts, but completely normal because I did).  

My focus is technically-driven, design-minded, creative, and inclusive journalism, and I care a lot about experimenting with new media to tell powerful and complex stories in innovative ways. An example of this can be seen in ["Phantom in Phoenix"](http://djnf.atavist.com/), an immersive multimedia project about *The Phantom of the Opera*'s U.S. Tour, for which I was the story designer and web editor.  

I spend most of my time figuring out how to bridge comedy, technology, design, and journalism, and you can see some of those efforts on this site. If I have any free time, you can find me memorizing public transportation lines, [making lists](http://www.gstarr.me/projects), [impulse buying silly domain names](http://beyonce.horse/), exploring the great outdoors and/or [deep web](http://portfolio.gstarr.me/), or teaching myself a new skill.  

If you'd like to talk, see more of my work, or hire me to do something cool for you, please feel free to <a href="mailto:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#064;&#103;&#115;&#116;&#097;&#114;&#114;&#046;&#109;&#101;?subject=Hi%20Graham%21">reach out</a> at any time.
