I'm **Graham Starr**, a journalist and website based in New York, currently global business editor at [Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/), working across the Americas companies news desk. I've spent most of my career building teams of reporters and editors to tell stories about business and technology in new ways. I'm also a rigorous story editor who has led teams to break news on and investigate some of the world's most powerful companies. (Got a tip? [Send me an email](mailto:&#103;&#115;&#116;&#97;&#114;&#114;&#51;&#50;&#49;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;?subject=Hi%20Graham%21) using a nonwork device. [Use PGP](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-mac-os-x) for extra security. [Here is my PGP public key](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x635622B12A5EE096).)   

Before I joined Bloomberg, I was senior tech editor at [*Business Insider*](https://www.businessinsider.com/sai), where I led a 10-person reporting team investigating Big Tech. We reported on [misconduct in the upper ranks of Google](https://www.businessinsider.com/deepmind-mustafa-suleyman-google-allegations-bullying-settlements-2021-8), [“dark patterns” in Amazon Prime subscription signups](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-ftc-probe-customer-complaints-sign-ups-internal-documents-2022-3), [staggering injury rates at Amazon warehouses](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-fined-serious-violation-washington-state-warehouse-worker-safety-2022-3) and [secret surveillance contracts](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-amazon-microsoft-ice-cbp-third-party-contracts-cloud-2021-10). Our work has been cited by regulators, shortlisted for international reporting contests and forced changes inside companies.

I’ve also written for *The New York Times*, *Wired*, *The Atlantic*, *New York* Magazine, and Slate, and my [projects and artworks](https://gstarr.me/projects/) have been featured in the *Washington Post*, *Fortune*, NPR, and HuffPost, among others. In 2017, I was part of a team at *The Atlantic* that won an ASME Award for work on an [interactive timeline](https://www.theatlantic.com/timeline).         

Earlier in my career, I was a senior staff editor at [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/), working mostly on breaking news, business news, and special reports, and was a founding editor of “Happening Now,” an experiment in visual news that’s now part of The *Times’* app and homepage. Before that, I was an editor at [*New York* Magazine](http://nymag.com)'s tech site, [Select All](https://nymag.com/selectall), and previously worked for [*WIRED*](https://www.wired.com/) and [*The Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/projects).

I've also led workshops on media, art, and technology at NYU’s [Interactive Telecommunications Program](https://itp.nyu.edu/) and lectured for journalism and writing classes at NYU and CUNY. (Want me to speak to your class? [Send me an email](mailto:gstarr321@gmail.com?subject=Hi%20Graham%21)!)
