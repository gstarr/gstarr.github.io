**Graham Starr** (me) is a New York-based (but currently in D.C.) freelance writer, designer, journalist, and humorist who makes things with computers and only speaks in the third person for one, self-referential sentence. Right now, I'm a fellow on [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com)'s [special projects](http://theatlantic.com/special-report) team.   

I'm interested in experimental media and comedy/tech/journalism cool intersectional interdisciplinary crossover things. In 2016 so far, I participated in [Comedy Hack Day](www.comedyhackday.org/sf-2016) where my team, [EquiTable](http://www.equitableapp.com/) (formerly Equipay, but changed because of ðŸŽ¶trademarkðŸŽ¶), won the grand-prize with a bill-splitting app that uses Bureau of Labor Statistics data to account for historic wage inequity. I have also done things with [Stupid Hackathon](http://www.stupidhackathon.com), [The Useless Press](http://www.uselesspress.org/), and [An Evening of Humorous Readings](http://humorousreadings.tumblr.com/).    

This past summer, I [wrote a thing](https://storify.com/GrahamStarr/scott-walker-really-likes-hot-ham) about Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's fascination with "hot ham" sandwiches. It's really strange and went *sort of viral* on The Internetâ„¢.   

Before I was at The Atlantic, I was a media consultant with the UN Refugee Agency's [digital innovation incubator](http://projecthive.nyc/). Before that, I was a DJNF digital intern at the [Christian Science Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/About/People/Graham-Starr), where I wrote about technology and served as the mobile lead on the website's feature redesign. In May 2015, I was the story designer for the Dow Jones News Fund's "[Phantom in Phoenix](http://djnf.atavist.com/)" multimedia reporting project.  

In college, I was the Editor-in-Chief of Tufts University's humor magazine, [The Zamboni](http://www.tuftszamboni.com/), which would be a weird sentence if I went to a college that wasn't Tufts. I revived and [redesigned](http://dropr.com/gstarr/57501/humor_magazine_redesign/) the decades-old publication, launching its first website and growing its staff from five to 60. Currently, the group is one of the most active on campus, developing experimental comedy projects in addition to printing its monthly magazine.    

More of my rÃ©sumÃ© can be seen by looking at [my rÃ©sumÃ©](http://gstarr.me/projects/resume).  

If you'd like to talk or hire me to do something cool for you, please <a href="mailto:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#064;&#103;&#115;&#116;&#097;&#114;&#114;&#046;&#109;&#101;?subject=Hi%20Graham%21">email me</a> at any time. I'd love to hear from you!
