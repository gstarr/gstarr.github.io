**Graham Starr** is a New York-based freelance writer, designer, and journalist who makes things with computers. He made this website. He also made this text. Sometimes "things" means words and not just physical objects or products. He usually only speaks in the third person for one paragraph.

This past summer I was a [Dow Jones News Fund](http://www.newsfund.org/) Digital Media Intern at the award-winning Christian Science Monitor in Boston. There, I served as a [staff writer](http://www.csmonitor.com/About/People/Graham-Starr) covering technology, security, privacy, and culture for the Innovations desk. I was also a digital designer for the Monitor, and the mobile and tablet lead on the website's feature redesign.

My focus is technically-driven, design-minded, inclusive journalism, and I care a lot about using new media to tell powerful stories in the most effective way. I firmly believe that medium shouldn't be constricting, and so my mission is to simply design complex stories to create the most impact. An example of this can be seen with ["Phantom in Phoenix"](http://djnf.atavist.com/), an immersive, multimedia project for which I acted as digital designer and web editor.  

I'm really interested in experimental approaches to media, bridging comedy, technology, and journalism in positive ways.
