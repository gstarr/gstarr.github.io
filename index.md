**Graham Starr** (me) is a New York-based freelance writer, designer, journalist, and humorist who makes things with computers and only speaks in the third person for one, self-referential sentence. Right now, I'm working with the UN Refugee Agency as a media consultant.  

My focus is on technically-driven, design-minded, creative, and inclusive journalism, and I care a lot about experimenting with new media to tell powerful and complex stories in innovative ways.  

Before, I was a [Dow Jones News Fund](http://www.newsfund.org/) Digital Media Intern at the award-winning [Christian Science Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/About/People/Graham-Starr) in Boston, covering technology and culture for the Innovations desk and leading the mobile team on the Monitor's [feature redesign](http://gstarr.me/projects/design). After my internship ended, I was kept on as a freelance designer.  In May, I worked with the 13 other DJNF digital interns to create ["Phantom in Phoenix"](http://djnf.atavist.com/), an immersive multimedia project about *The Phantom of the Opera*'s U.S. Tour in Phoenix, Ariz., for which I was the project's story designer and web editor.  

In college, I was the Editor-in-Chief of [Tufts University's humor magazine](http://www.tuftszamboni.com/), which would be a weird sentence if I didn't go to Tufts but makes complete sense because I did.   

More of my resume can be found on my [resume](http://gstarr.me/projects/resume).  

I spend most of my time figuring out how to bridge comedy, technology, design, and journalism, and you can see some of [those efforts](http://gstarr.me/projects/misc) on this site. If I have any free time, you can find me memorizing public transportation lines, exploring the great outdoors and/or [deep web](http://www.cachemonet.com/), [making lists](http://www.gstarr.me/projects), [impulse buying silly domain names](http://beyonce.horse/), rock climbing, or teaching myself a new skill.  

If you'd like to talk, see more of my work, or hire me to do something cool for you, please feel free to <a href="mailto:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#064;&#103;&#115;&#116;&#097;&#114;&#114;&#046;&#109;&#101;?subject=Hi%20Graham%21">reach out</a> at any time.
