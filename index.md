**Graham Starr** (me) is a journalist and editor who makes things with math, art, and computers. I focus on interactive projects, digital features, and investigations ([here is my PGP key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xDB0D92DF71F4416F)). Currently, I'm on staff at [*WIRED*](https://www.wired.com/) magazine as the assistant to the editor-in-chief.   

Before I was at *WIRED*, I was a member of *[The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com)*’s ✨[special projects](http://theatlantic.com/projects) team✨ where I built, managed, and edited cool features (such as [a retrospective](https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/the-obama-era/) on the Obama presidency, [an oral history](http://www.theatlantic.com/projects/inside-jobs/) of the American workforce, and [an interactive](https://www.theatlantic.com/timeline/) on how the world has changed during your lifetime (the last of which won a [2017 MPA Imagination Award](http://www.magazine.org/events/past-events/imagination-awards-2017))).   

I'm interested in experimental media and the intersection of comedy, tech, and journalism. I've participated in [Comedy Hack Day](www.comedyhackday.org/sf-2016) where, in 2016, my team [EquiTable](http://www.equitableapp.com/), [won the grand prize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlR1Y2Lwz48) with a bill-splitting app that uses Bureau of Labor Statistics data to account for historic wage inequity. I've also done things with [Stupid Hackathon](http://www.stupidhackathon.com) and [The Useless Press](http://www.uselesspress.org/), and read jokes with [An Evening of Humorous Readings](http://humorousreadings.tumblr.com/). I also occasionally work with NYU's [Interactive Telecommunications Program](https://itp.nyu.edu/) (ITP), and this summer was an “Instigator” at the program’s [ITP Camp](https://itp.nyu.edu/camp2017/), where I helped lead workshops on media, art, and technology.      

Before I was at *The Atlantic*, I was a media consultant with the UN Refugee Agency's (UNHCR) [special projects unit](http://projecthive.nyc/). Before that, I was a *Dow Jones News Fund* digital intern at the *[Christian Science Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/About/People/Graham-Starr)*, where I wrote about technology and served on the digital design team. I was also the story designer and web editor for the *Dow Jones News Fund*’s "[Phantom in Phoenix](http://djnf.atavist.com/)" multimedia reporting project.   

In a previous life (before media), I was an intelligence analyst focusing on science and technology.     

In college, I was the editor-in-chief of Tufts University's humor magazine, *[The Zamboni](http://www.tuftszamboni.com/)*. I revived and [redesigned](http://dropr.com/gstarr/57501/humor_magazine_redesign/) the then-25-year-old publication, launching its first website and growing its staff from five to 60. The group is still active on campus, developing experimental comedy projects in addition to printing its monthly magazine.    

More of my résumé can be seen by looking at [my résumé](http://gstarr.me/projects/resume).
