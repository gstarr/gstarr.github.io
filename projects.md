### [Tufts Mugs Photography Project](http://www.facebook.com/tuftsmugs)  
A positive psychology project during finals week of my sophomore year at Tufts. I documented as many members of the Tufts community as possible making silly faces (more than 2500 people over the course of the week). This was only a few weeks after the Boston Marathon bombings, and many on campus were stil shaken up. I felt that doing something silly, simple, and innovative would allow people a little brightness into an otherwise stressful time. At its height, the project -- hosted on Facebook for ease of sharing -- had 20,000 impressions a day. Tufts Mugs, by design, lasted only a week.

Tufts Mugs was also featured on [Narratively](http://narrative.ly/stories/wipe-that-final-off-your-face/) and the Tufts Admissions magazine. I've been told since that it was the deciding factor for why some students chose to attend Tufts.  

  
### [Scott Walker Really Likes Hot Ham](https://storify.com/GrahamStarr/scott-walker-really-likes-hot-ham)  
A storify curating the tweets of Wisconsin Governor and former 2016 Presidential hopeful Scott Walker. Spoiler: he tweets a lot about ham.

This ended up "going viral" within the political comedy community, garnering several thousand views and shares on Storify and Twitter.  

  
### [Spigot Magazine](http://www.spigotmag.com/)  
National anthology showcasing the humor and satirical work of 27 college campuses across the country.  
  
   
### [Tufts Free Compliments Positive Psychology Group](https://www.facebook.com/tuftsfreecompliments)  
Positive psychology group called a "[Quirky College Club](http://college.usatoday.com/2012/11/19/6-quirky-college-clubs/)" by *USA Today*. Unlike the other projects listed here, I did not start Tufts Free Compliments, but instead served as its [publicity director](http://tuftsdaily.com/news/2012/11/30/tufts-free-compliments-helps-promote-positive-psychology-on-facebook/), directing media outreach, expanding the group, and building [large-scale, creative projects](http://i.imgur.com/TrAS0BO.jpg).  

  
### [Internet Adventure project](http://portfolio.gstarr.me/)   
Still under construction. Expansive satirical project using permalinks and dated social media markers to create a facade of time travel within a massive Internet adventure.
