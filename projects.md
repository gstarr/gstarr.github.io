**[Scott Walker Really Likes Hot Ham](https://storify.com/GrahamStarr/scott-walker-really-likes-hot-ham)**  <small><i>July 2015</i></small>    
  A storify curating the tweets of Wisconsin Governor and former 2016 Presidential hopeful Scott Walker. Spoiler: he tweets a lot about ham.

  This ended up "going viral" within the political comedy community, with several thousand views and shares on Storify and Twitter.  

**"[Phantom in Phoenix](http://djnf.atavist.com/)"** <small>Dow Jones News Fund — <i>May 2015</i></small>     
  When "The Phantom of the Opera" travels around the world, what comes with it? A look into the show's culture, history, commerce, and crew.
  
  Mobile-first, fully-integrated, multimedia reporting project created with 13 other student journalists as part of the [Dow Jones News Fund](http://www.newsfund.org)'s week-long digital journalism bootcamp at the Walter Cronkite School at Arizona State University. Acted as story designer and web editor for the project.  

**[Tufts Mugs Photography Project](http://www.facebook.com/tuftsmugs)**  <small><i>May 2013</i></small>    
  A positive psychology project during finals week of my sophomore year at Tufts. I documented as many members of the Tufts community as possible making silly faces (more than 2500 people over the course of the week). This was only a few weeks after the Boston Marathon bombings, and many on campus were stil shaken up. I felt that doing something silly, simple, and innovative would allow people a little brightness into an otherwise stressful time. At its height, the project — hosted on Facebook for ease of sharing — had 20,000 impressions a day.

  Tufts Mugs was also featured on [Narratively](http://narrative.ly/stories/wipe-that-final-off-your-face/) and the Tufts Admissions magazine. I've been told since that it was a deciding factor for why some students chose to attend Tufts.
