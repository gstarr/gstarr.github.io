**[Tufts Mugs Photography Project](http://www.facebook.com/tuftsmugs)**  *May 2013*   
A positive psychology project during finals week of my sophomore year at Tufts. I documented as many members of the Tufts community as possible making silly faces (more than 2500 people over the course of the week). This was only a few weeks after the Boston Marathon bombings, and many on campus were stil shaken up. I felt that doing something silly, simple, and innovative would allow people a little brightness into an otherwise stressful time. At its height, the project — hosted on Facebook for ease of sharing — had 20,000 impressions a day.

Tufts Mugs was also featured on [Narratively](http://narrative.ly/stories/wipe-that-final-off-your-face/) and the Tufts Admissions magazine. I've been told since that it was the deciding factor for why some students chose to attend Tufts.

**[Scott Walker Really Likes Hot Ham](https://storify.com/GrahamStarr/scott-walker-really-likes-hot-ham)**  *July 2015*  
A storify curating the tweets of Wisconsin Governor and former 2016 Presidential hopeful Scott Walker. Spoiler: he tweets a lot about ham.

This ended up "going viral" within the political comedy community, garnering several thousand views and shares on Storify and Twitter.

**[Spigot Magazine](http://www.spigotmag.com/)**  *Fall 2015*  
National anthology showcasing the humor and satirical work of 27 college campuses across the country.

**[Tufts Free Compliments Positive Psychology Group](https://www.facebook.com/tuftsfreecompliments/)**  *2011–2013*  
Positive psychology group called a "[Quirky College Club](http://college.usatoday.com/2012/11/19/6-quirky-college-clubs/)" by *USA Today*. Unlike the other projects listed here, I did not start Tufts Free Compliments, but instead served as its [publicity director](http://tuftsdaily.com/news/2012/11/30/tufts-free-compliments-helps-promote-positive-psychology-on-facebook/), directing media outreach, expanding the group, and building [large-scale, creative projects](http://i.imgur.com/TrAS0BO.jpg).

**[Internet Adventure project](http://portfolio.gstarr.me/)**   *In Progress*  
Still under construction. Expansive satirical project using permalinks and dated social media markers to create a facade of time travel within a massive Internet adventure.
