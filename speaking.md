I love to talk about technology, art, media, and comedy, and the new ways we make journalism interesting. I'm available to speak on your podcast, at your conference, on your panel, in your classroom, or on a boat*. [Book me!](mailto:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#064;&#103;&#115;&#116;&#097;&#114;&#114;&#046;&#109;&#101;?subject=Booking%20Inquiry)  

<small>* No one has asked me yet to speak on a boat, and honestly it would have to be a pretty sweet boat.</small>
