Tasked with incorporating several new features from desktop site — including infinite scroll, recommended articles, and “save for later” features — while maintaining aesthetic appeal and brand identity. Goal was to prioritize keeping readers on the site, and highlighting the stories recommended by Editors.   

Major implementations: Menu shows recommended articles, as well as articles in the reader's queue, and only shows navigation "below the fold". Two-thirds through an article, readers will see a slide-up notification of what’s next on their reading list, and have the ability to remove an item from the queue using one of the x's or by sliding the item to the left. Removing an item automatically populates the list with another recommended story, and creates a passive commitment to reading using predictive and assumptive design.   

Redesign initially planned for end-of-year 2015 but postponed due to organization restructuring.
